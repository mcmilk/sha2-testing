sbase - suckless unix tools
===========================

sbase is a collection of unix tools that are inherently portable across
UNIX and UNIX-like systems.

The complement of sbase is ubase[1] which is Linux-specific and provides
all the non-portable tools. Together they are intended to form a base
system similar to busybox but much smaller and suckless.
